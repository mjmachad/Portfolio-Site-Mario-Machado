      <h1>Lingo & You</h1>
      <p>
        Lingo & You is a vocabulary app and the first concept I designed early on with CareerFoundry. The objective was to identify pain points in other existing products
        and utilize those weaknesses to make Lingo & You a strong competitor in the market.

        <h1>My Process</h1>
        <h3>Understanding the User</h3>
        <p>
          To undertsand the audience and objectives,  user interviews were conducted. I interviewed a total of four participants, both in person and online.
          Questions consisted of their experience using learning apps, the frequency of learning apps and the struggles they encoutnerd using them.
          This allowed me to develop a user persona from this information.

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Based on the initial interviews and user personas the main problem was to find a way for users to easily access lessons that will help her retain new vocabulary.
          The issue goes further that curretn apps are not as engaging as they should be. 
        </p>
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>
          An app that would only require the user to use for 5-10 mins a day on their way to work or at home before bed.
          An app that could relate to them on an occupation basis (ie, Murals and Statues) or from a traveling point of view.
        </p>
        <h3>Prototpying</h3>
        <p>
          Now that a plan was in place I began to create low fidelity prototypes through sketching.
          Along with creating the solution there were other requirements for Lingo & You. Below you can see the early mockups.

        <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
        <p>
          To ensure the images could be used in the usability testing I made them interactive with each other using "Marvel".
          The usability testing consisted of four individuals who  were given four different scenarios with one task attached to each scenario. The tasks were as followed:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Login</li>
          <li>Create a Flashcard from Scratch</li>
          <li>Learn a New Language</li>
          <li>Access the Flaschard Deck</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The overall usability test was a success, the feedback I received was quite helpful. I created a test report outlining all the issues and gave them a severity rating.
          Feedback with a high severity were reviewed and implemented later on.

        <h3>Refinement</h3>
        <p>
          With the recommendations and observations complete. I went back to the drawing baord and imrpoved upon some of the concepts.
          Some of the more important iterations were done to the login and interface of the flashcards.

                <li>Hard to formulate a bunch of ideas into a succinct flow.</li>
                <li>Taking into account other user ideas and judging whether or not they add value to the product can be difficult.</li>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Conducting all the work for this project was both exciting and nerve wracking. I gained some very important skills especially in user research and information architecture.
            While I was not able to conitnue to iterate on the design and create high level mockups I was able to empathize with the users while also creating a product that I feel confident in. 
            With that said, I was also to identify certain areas of the process that I excel in and other components that require more work.
